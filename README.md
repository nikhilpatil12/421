# 4-2-1 Loop Demonstration Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS demonstration that takes user input and showcases the 4-2-1 loop for any entered number. The 4-2-1 loop is a sequence where, for any positive integer entered, if it is even, the next number is obtained by dividing it by 2; if it is odd, the next number is obtained by multiplying it by 4 and adding 1. This process is repeated until the sequence reaches the number 1.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input any positive integer.
- Visualization of the 4-2-1 loop sequence for the entered number.
- Clear display of each step in the sequence.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
